            <P>
                Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
                species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
                green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product:
                roasted coffee, which is ground into a powder and typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
                out, producing a cup of coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating
                effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the
                world,[4] and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè
                latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is
                common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be
                served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells
                prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling
                cannabis).

                    <h3>History Of Coffee......</h3>
                    <p>
                        The history of coffee dates back to 850 AD, and possibly earlier with a number of reports and
                        legends surrounding its first use.

                        There is evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree from the early 15th
                        century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen,[1] spreading soon to Mecca and Medina. By the 16th
                        century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey,
                        India,
                        and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as
                        well as
                        Southeast Asia despite the bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca
                        and
                        Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church

                    <h3>Is Coffee Bad For You?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overall, coffee can have a lot of positive effects on the body. It’s health benefits include
                        reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, improving the resting metabolic rate, and can even reduce
                        the risk of certain types of cancers. Coffee can help ward off cognitive decline and boost
                        long-term memory, and even reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. As well as these physical
                        effects, coffee contains a large amount of nutrients and antioxidants such as vitamins B2, B3
                        and B5. The negatives of coffee are considerably smaller – becoming addicted to coffee and
                        suffering withdrawal symptoms such as headaches is one example. The positives largely outweigh
                        the negatives, but if you are drinking a large amount of coffee it could lead to disrupting your
                        sleep due to a large caffeine intake.
